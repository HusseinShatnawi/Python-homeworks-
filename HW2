# This program is for a company to buy 10 tickts for useres and every user can buy five tickts everytime and finally the program will show the transactions numbers
# And it will inform the user if there is any mistake happened by the user 


# We start to define variables of the total numbers of tickts that we have (As a global variable)  and the transaction counter 
TOTALTICKTS = 10
transactionsCounter = 0

# If we have tickts then the while statement will be excuted, otherwise the loop will be terminated and the user will get a notification 
# The first loop ( while loop) is to confirm that we have tickts to buy ; if we have tickts, the loop will be proceeded
while TOTALTICKTS > 0:


    print('We have ', TOTALTICKTS,'tickts.', ' How many tickts you want ?')        # this statement will tell the user how many tickts we have and to ask him to order 
    newOrder = int(input(''))   # input statement to take the order from the user and proceed it 
    if newOrder <= TOTALTICKTS:                # if statement to check the order is valid , or to confirm we have enough amounts of tickts for the order
     if newOrder > 0 :
      if newOrder <= 5 :                       # if statement to confirm the user can order only 5 tickts as max. numebr 
         transactionsCounter += 1              # counter to counter the transactions 
         TOTALTICKTS -= newOrder               # counter to find the totoal amount of tickts that we have 
         print(" The process has done, and you have got ",newOrder , " tickts . Thank you !! ")      # to print the feedback for the user 

      else :
        print(' You exceed the limit, you can buy only five tickts and you ask to buy  ', newOrder, ' !!' )        # To inform the user he exceeded the limit

    else :
      print(' we Could''nt help you, we have only ' , TOTALTICKTS, ' Tickts')                   # To inform the user how much tickts we have
